### *Problem Description* ###
We are given three pegs or rods and **n** number of disks, initially all the disks are added to the first peg (the leftmost one) in decreasing size order (smaller disks are placed over the larger disks). The objective is to transfer the entire stack of disks from the first peg to the third peg (the rightmost one), moving only one disk at a time and never a large one onto a smaller one.
